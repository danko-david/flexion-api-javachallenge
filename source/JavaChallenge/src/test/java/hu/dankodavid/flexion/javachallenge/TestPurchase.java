	 * Runs the integration tests, provided with the documentation.
	 * 
	 * Note:
	 * This kind of library distribution (I mean sending/downloading jar files)
	 * it deprecated. The main reason: it's scales bad and difficult to integrate 
	 * 1) Binary files are not for git repos: 
	 *   As the project evolves and libraries getting updated, old jar files
	 *   become unwanted element. But because of git, it's takes space as old
	 *   commit files.
	 * 2) If JAR not stored in the repository, it cause difficulties to manage
	 *   the project in a CI software like jenkins.
	 * 3) When tests become more complex, and start picking up dependencies.
	 *   Well, managing dependecines by downloading set of jar files is a way
	 *   to hell. 
	 * 
	 * What to do instead:
	 * 	Create a maven repository and publish dependencies there.
	 * It doesn't require though infrastructure, see my own maven repository:
	 * https://maven.javaexperience.eu/
	 * 
	 * Benefits:
	 * 1) Easy to manage previous versions of test without polluting git.
	 * 2) Common library utility classes, source codes, heavy resource files and
	 *    even tests cases can be shared using a maven repository.
	 * 3) Easy to integrate. Just add a <repository> entry, reference the
	 *    utility you want to use, and reference a test set version you want to satisfy.
	 *    This works good with Maven CLI and with Jenkins as well.

	 * Note:
	 * Failure tests for bad API usage.
	 * In this scenario, I thinking with a mind of a tester, who should test an API
	 * connector written by someone else.
	 * I saw many time such implementation:
	 * <code>
	 * 	try

	 * 	catch(Throwable e)
	 * 	{

	 * </code>
	 * (Note that logging is on trace level, and Exceptions.propagateAnyway() not called)
	 * 
	 * This can happen easily when the interface do not enable to throw any exception
	 * but implementation code does, and IDE automatic try-catch wrapping block created.
	 * 
	 * If the application is written well, and issues are rare, it might hard to catch
	 * the issue. Method returns silently as it like to succeed, but it don't.
